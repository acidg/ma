I would first like to thank Dr. Martin Feilkas for inspiring me to write this thesis and my thesis advisor Dr. Benjamin Hummel for his perseverance, time and support during the whole time I wrote this thesis.
Also, I want to thank Prof. Manfred Broy for agreeing to supervise this thesis.

I would also like to acknowledge my fellow students and friends Nils Kunze and Thomas Pettinger for proofreading this thesis, and I am gratefully indebted to their very valuable comments on this thesis.
A special thanks goes out to my friends and roommates Albert Steckermeier and Viktoriia Rakytianska for proofreading, giving me useful advices and helping me out, whenever I had questions.

Furthermore I would like to thank my colleagues at CQSE GmbH for supporting me when I had questions and giving me the opportunity to write this thesis in a gracious and welcoming working environment.

Finally, I must express my gratitude to my parents and to my girlfriend Isabella Fageth for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis.
This accomplishment would not have been possible without them.
