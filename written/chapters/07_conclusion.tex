\section{Future Work}
This sections lists some ideas for further improving the approach.

\subsection{Distribution for High Loads}
Since this work proposes a client-server architecture, it is important to provide a reliable service to a huge amount of clients.
Therefor, distributing the index on several machines is desirable for load balancing.
This could easily be done by distributing the database onto the machines whenever the index is updated.

It may also be advisable to group reference projects by license or other parameters like origin of the code (GitHub, Bitbucket, Debian source repositories, \dots).
Pairs of servers and filters responsible for a group of reference projects could be created.
This would result in multiple small hash filters and enables clients to only choose filters of their interest, further reducing the size of the filter a client has to download and keep up to date.
The requests resulting from matches in the filter on the client side then have to be routed to the server responsible for the corresponding group of reference projects.

\subsubsection{Higher Accuracy History Analysis}
